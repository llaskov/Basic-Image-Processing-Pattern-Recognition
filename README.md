# Basic-Image-Processing-Pattern-Recognition
Basic algorithms for image processing and pattern recognition.

Implementation of some of the basic algorithms used in the course of DSCM026 Image processing and pattern recognition in New Bulgarian University. The course is based on the following books:

Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods, Digital Image Processing, 4th Edition, Pearson, 2018. URL

Milan Sonka, Vaclav Hlavac, Roger Boyle, Image Processing, Analysis and Machine Vision, Cengage Learning, 2015. URL

Duda, Richard O., Hart, Peter E. and Stork, David G., Pattern Classification (2nd Edition), 2 : Wiley-Interscience, 2000.

The examples are implemented in C++ programming language with a minor use of the Qt framework.
